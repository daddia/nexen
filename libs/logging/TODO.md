# TODO: Logging Module Enhancements

## High Priority

- [ ] **Log Rotation**: Integrate with file rotation libraries (e.g., `lumberjack`) to automatically rotate log files based on size/time.
- [ ] **Sampling Support**: Add configurable sampling for high-volume log events to reduce storage requirements.
- [ ] **Request ID Tracking**: Add helpers for propagating request IDs across service boundaries.
- [ ] **Sanitization Helpers**: Provide utilities to redact sensitive information (passwords, tokens, PII) from logs.
- [ ] **Structured Error Handling**: Add helpers for consistent error logging with stack traces.

## Medium Priority

- [ ] **Environment-Aware Configuration**: Automatically adjust logging based on detected environment (dev/staging/prod).
- [ ] **Log Hooks**: Support for registering callbacks when logs of specific levels/patterns are generated.
- [ ] **Cloud Provider Integration**: Add adapters for cloud logging services (AWS CloudWatch, GCP Logging, etc.).
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarks**: Add benchmarks to measure and track logging performance overhead.
- [ ] **Metrics Integration**: Connect logging events with metrics/telemetry for error rate tracking.

## Low Priority

- [ ] **Advanced Context Features**: Support for logging context values automatically.
- [ ] **Additional Log Formats**: Support for formats beyond JSON (e.g., logfmt, CEF, W3C).
- [ ] **Color Support**: Enhance console output with customizable ANSI colors.
- [ ] **Async Logging**: Add non-blocking logging option for performance-critical paths.
- [ ] **Log Explorer**: Simple web UI for viewing/filtering structured logs during development.

## Standards & Documentation

- [ ] **Standard Log Levels**: Define and document standard log levels for all Nexen services.
- [ ] **Log Schema**: Define a standard schema for common fields across all services.
- [ ] **Best Practices Guide**: Create documentation with logging best practices.
- [ ] **Integration Examples**: Add examples for common frameworks and libraries.
- [ ] **Observability Guide**: Document how logging fits into the broader observability strategy.

## Technical Debt

- [ ] **Zerolog Version Updates**: Regularly review and update the zerolog dependency.
- [ ] **API Cleanup**: Review for any redundant or confusing APIs.
- [ ] **Documentation Generation**: Set up godoc or similar for API documentation.
