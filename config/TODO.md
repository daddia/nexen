# Configuration Module TODO List

This document outlines the required improvements to make the configuration module production-ready.

## Priority Issues

1. **Configuration Validation**
   - [ ] Add validation for all configuration values
   - [ ] Create validators for time durations, ports, URLs, etc.
   - [ ] Add custom validation for service-specific configurations
   - [ ] Implement validation during loading to fail early

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - [ ] Implement sensitive value masking for logs (passwords, tokens, etc.)
   - [ ] Add support for encrypted configuration values
   - [ ] Support for external secret management systems (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
   - [ ] Ensure safe handling of Redis passwords and other credentials
   - [ ] Add field tags for sensitive values: `sensitive:"true"`

3. **Configuration Reloading**
   - [ ] Add support for hot-reloading configuration changes
   - [ ] Implement file watching using fsnotify
   - [ ] Add signal handling (SIGHUP) for configuration reload
   - [ ] Provide reload callbacks for services to handle changed values
   - [ ] Support atomic configuration updates

## Feature Enhancements

4. **Environment Support**
   - [ ] Add explicit support for different environments (dev, staging, prod)
   - [ ] Support for environment-specific configuration files (`nexen.{env}.json`)
   - [ ] Handle configuration overlays/inheritance between environments
   - [ ] Add helper to determine current environment

5. **Observability Integration**
   - [ ] Expose configuration change events as metrics
   - [ ] Add structured logging for configuration operations
   - [ ] Include OTEL tracing for configuration operations
   - [ ] Add configuration for sampling rates and tracing endpoints

6. **Configuration Storage**
   - [ ] Support for remote configuration (etcd, Consul, etc.)
   - [ ] Support for multiple configuration sources with priority
   - [ ] Implement caching for remote configuration
   - [ ] Add support for JSON, YAML, TOML, and other formats

## Technical Improvements

7. **Refactoring and Extension**
   - [ ] Extract interfaces for better testability
   - [ ] Split monolithic `Config` struct into smaller, focused components
   - [ ] Support for registering custom configuration sections
   - [ ] Add generic support for service-specific configurations

8. **Error Handling**
   - [ ] Create dedicated error types for different failure modes
   - [ ] Improve error messages with context and suggestions
   - [ ] Add recovery mechanisms for non-critical configuration errors
   - [ ] Implement graceful degradation for partial configuration

9. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Add more examples for common use cases
   - [ ] Create diagrams of configuration flow and architecture
   - [ ] Document all configuration fields with validation rules
   - [ ] Add Godoc comments for all exported types and functions

## Testing and Reliability

10. **Test Coverage**
    - [ ] Increase test coverage to >85%
    - [ ] Add property-based tests for validation rules
    - [ ] Add benchmarks for configuration loading and access
    - [ ] Create integration tests with real file system operations
    - [ ] Add tests for environment variables handling

11. **Reliability Improvements**
    - [ ] Add defensive loading with fallback to defaults
    - [ ] Implement timeout handling for remote configuration
    - [ ] Handle temporary file system access issues gracefully
    - [ ] Add circuit breakers for remote configuration sources

## Service Integration

12. **Service-Specific Enhancements**
    - [ ] Create default configurations for all Nexen services
    - [ ] Add validation specific to each service's requirements
    - [ ] Support for service dependencies in configuration
    - [ ] Add service discovery configuration

13. **Deployment Considerations**
    - [ ] Document configuration deployment strategies
    - [ ] Add Kubernetes ConfigMap and Secret integration
    - [ ] Support for configuration bootstrapping during first run
    - [ ] Create configuration migration tools for version updates

## Development Tools

14. **Developer Experience**
    - [ ] Create configuration schema generation for validation
    - [ ] Add CLI tool for configuration validation
    - [ ] Create configuration visualization tools
    - [ ] Add configuration documentation generator
